              . I‚Äôm a developer and community builder who loves creating things
              that bring people together. I build tools, write my learnings, and
              explore how communities can flourish through technology. I care
              about making technology feel simple, approachable, and human.

              Outside of work, I‚Äôm someone who feels most alive with music
              around me. I love dancing, exploring new places, and capturing
              small moments with my camera. Those pieces of joy fuel the energy
              I bring back into my work.

                I started my career building web applications and working with
                cloud infrastructure, where I learned how much design and
                usability matter. From the beginning I was drawn to open source
                and the way it connects people through shared tools and
                knowledge. Over time I became most passionate about creating UI
                libraries, developer tools, and community-driven projects that
                help others build faster and better. Now I am exploring how AI
                can expand that work by making creativity, collaboration, and
                technology even more accessible.
